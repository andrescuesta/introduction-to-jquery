# [Introduction to jQuery][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Web developers have had to overcome a lot of obstacles. Probably the biggest hurdle that we've faced is the browser itself. Not only have we had to work around the incompatibilities of various browsers, but even at the best of times, we've been faced with hard-to-use, low-level APIs like the Document Object Model (DOM) and XmlHttpRequest. Many libraries have been created to work around these problems, but one in particular has stood the test of time and has become the de facto standard: jQuery. In fact, jQuery is so popular that you would be hard-pressed to find a website that doesn't use it!

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will teach you everything you need to know to get started using jQuery in your projects. First, we'll look at getting and setting up the library, then we'll jump right into using it to change the content on a page. You'll learn how to use jQuery to manipulate elements, including changing styles and attributes, then you'll go on to use events, animation and AJAX. At the end, you'll have a chance to practice some of these concepts by writing a fully-functional accordion component.
